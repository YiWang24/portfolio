# CS61B - Data Structures Course Projects

## Overview
My solutions and implementations for UC Berkeley's CS61B: Data Structures course (Spring 2021).

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: Java
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **Testing**: JUnit

## Projects Completed

### Project 0: 2048 Game
- Implemented the classic 2048 sliding puzzle game
- Learned about 2D arrays and game state management

### Project 1: Deques
- Built ArrayDeque and LinkedListDeque from scratch
- Achieved O(1) operations for add/remove at both ends

### Project 2: Gitlet
- Created a mini version control system like Git
- Implemented commits, branches, merging, and remote operations
- This was my favorite project - really helped me understand how Git works internally!

### Project 3: BYOW (Build Your Own World)
- Generated random 2D tile-based worlds
- Implemented A* pathfinding algorithm
- Added save/load game functionality

## What I Learned
- Deep understanding of data structures: arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, hash tables
- Algorithm analysis and Big-O notation
- Test-driven development with JUnit
- Version control concepts through building Gitlet
